# UX Design

## The-Strategy-Plane

### Site-Goals

The site aim to give the user a brief review of the main motorsport categories of cars such as: Formula 1, IndyCar Series and Karting, for instance.

The user can access the contents, make their comments of the reviews, update and delete them, once their are authenticated. They can also submit any queries on the contact page, to the authors.

### Agile Methodologies

This project was developed using agile methodologies by categorise them into three instances: to-do, in-progress and done.

All issues were prioritized under the labels: 'Low Priority', 'Medium Priority' and 'High Priority'. They were assigned the user story pointed according to their needs. "High Priority" stories were completed first, following by "Medium Priority" and last but not least "Low Priority". It was done this way to ensure that all core requirements were completed first to give the project a complete user experience, with the nice to have features being added should there be capacity.

The Kanban board was created using github projects and can be located here and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. All stories except the documentation tasks have a full set of acceptance criteria in order to define the functionality that marks that story as complete.
